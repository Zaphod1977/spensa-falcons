            My name is Bobby Bridges. I am a 46 year old father, business owner, and now full stack developer. I have
            been in the tech world since I was a kid taking
            audio gear apart to figure out how it worked and how to make it do different things I wanted to make it do.
            That engenuity brought me to the audio/video and automation
            world back in July of 2000. From there I have rose to be one of the leading integrators in my region and
            also one of the most respected. But.....I've always wanted to
            learn how to write code and to discover the underpinnings of the computing world I so richly appreciate. So
            here I am...46 and learning to code. The next chapter will
            be to discover the new opportunities my newly earned skills will present me. Hello World.
